# Afterword

Good job, you got to the very end of this book. I hope it was a great experience
and I hope you learned how to build Minitest extensions.

In chapter one, we started with some introduction, on what Minitest is and it's
strong sides. Then, in the brief chapter two, we saw what functionlities Minitest
has and how we can write tests using it. In chapter three, we started diving a bit
into Minitest's extensibility. We saw a small example of how a Minitest plugin
looks like and we went off to chapter four. There we took our baby steps into
writing extensions and we built a simple plugin which adds colors to our test
results.

Then, in chapter five, we created a somewhat useful plugin, that shares the test
failures on Dpaste.com and adds the shareable link in the clipboard. We even
created a small API wrapper for it. Nifty little thing, eh? Finally, in chapter
six, we saw how to create a full blown plugin, using the SandiMeter gem. It sure
was a long one, but it payed out at the end.

I hope this tiny book was informative and fun as much as it was for me to research
and write on the topic. I would love to hear your thoughts on the book. Hit me
up on Twitter [@fteem](https://twitter.com/fteem), let's have a chat!

If you would like to read more from me, you can check out

refactoring, Rails and more once a week.

Thanks for reading!
