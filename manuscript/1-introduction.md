# Introduction

In Ruby land, testing is kind of a religion. The people in our Ruby ecosystem
have always encouraged testing, regardless of the level that we are testing at
by providing a ton of resources like videos, books, conference talks and others.

For beginners, testing is always a bit in the shadows - we know it's there, but
we are kind of scared to go and take a look. But, after we see how interesing
and useful of a technique testing is, it gets engraved in our daily work and
after a while we cannot imagine our work without it. I am sure this varies based
on the person, but at least for me testing was definitely the best technique
I have learned in my career.

Fortunately for us, the Ruby ecosystem has spawned couple of major testing
frameworks and utilities. The biggest one, by popularity and by lines of code
is definitely RSpec [1]. It has a vibrant community and a ton of supporters and
books on it.

On the other side of the spectrum, there is Minitest. Although very small, in
comparison with it's "competition", it is a testing tool for Ruby that provides
a complete suite of testing facilities. It might not have had the huge community
that RSpec as a tool did, but it sure does the trick well. Just like RSpec it
supports behaviour-driven development, mocking and benchmarking.

But, it's biggest recognition as a great testing tool, came with the release of
Ruby 1.9, when Minitest was added to Ruby's standard library. Even though at
first it gave off the impression of a very small testing tool, it has a very
rich set of features which make it a powerful tool to have under your belt.
